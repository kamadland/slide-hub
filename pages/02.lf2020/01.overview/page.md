### Where are we going as Bethany Student Ministries Leadership?

#### Objectives
* Identify where we have been.
* Imagine where we want to be.
* Clarify how we will get there.

#### Session Description
It is often too easy to fall into a pattern of behaviour that works against what we say we want to do in life and in ministry. This short session is intended to ensure that we don't fall into one of those patterns. This site will provide resources and some guideposts along the way as we think and share and define our direction.
